## What is AKAY

Akay is combination of an App and IoT device that helps the visually impaired read text using braille.
Akay uses text to braille technology that converts text input from the user and images and converts into braille for the visually impaired. The App uses python as its main programming language for the app and an Arduino R3 for the IoT device that converts the text into braille.

## How To Set Up

Install the following Python prerequisites to install the App:

*pyside6*
### pip install pyside6

PySide6 is a Python binding for the Qt cross-platform application and UI framework. It allows you to create applications with a native look and feel across different platforms.

*numpy*
### pip install numpy

NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

*opencv-python*
### pip install opencv-python

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.

*PyPDF2*
### pip install PyPDF2

PyPDF2 is a Python library for reading and manipulating PDF files.

*Pillow*
### pip install Pillow

Pillow is a Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork. It adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.

*google-generativeai*
### pip install google-generativeai
