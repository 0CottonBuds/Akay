## What is AKAY

AKAY is a combination of an App and IoT device that helps the visually impaired read text using braille.
AKAY uses text to braille technology that converts text input and images that converts data into braille for the visually impaired. The App uses python as its main programming language for the app and an Arduino R3 for the IoT device that converts the text into braille.

## Features

- **Text-to-Braille Conversion:** AKAY converts digital text input into Braille characters, facilitating easy comprehension for users familiar with Braille.
- **Real-time Translation:** Enjoy instant translation of text content into Braille, ensuring efficient communication and information access.
- **IoT Integration:** The IoT device serves as a tactile display, rendering Braille characters in real-time, offering a tangible reading experience.
- **Accessibility:** Designed with accessibility in mind, our app and IoT device prioritize user-friendly interfaces and intuitive controls.
- **Offline Functionality:** Benefit from the ability to use the app and IoT device without an internet connection, ensuring uninterrupted access to Braille translation services.

## How It Works

1. **Input Text:** Enter the desired text into the app interface.
2. **Conversion:** The app processes the input text and converts it into Braille characters.
3. **IoT Display:** The IoT device receives the Braille output from the app and displays it dynamically on its tactile surface.
4. **Interactivity:** Users can interact with the IoT device, such as navigating through Braille pages, adjusting settings, and accessing additional features.

## How To Set Up

**App Prerequesites**:

1. **pyside6**
   
### pip install pyside6
PySide6 is a Python binding for the Qt cross-platform application and UI framework. It allows you to create applications with a native look and feel across different platforms.

2. **numpy**
   
- ### pip install numpy

NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

3. **opencv-python**

### pip install opencv-python
